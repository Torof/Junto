-- Migration 00125: a successful QR scan validates the creator's presence too.
-- Generating the QR is gated on T-30min and the creator's identity; a
-- participant successfully scanning it means the creator was on-site
-- showing the code. Use that as the creator's self-validation path —
-- otherwise the UI gives them no way to mark themselves present, which
-- breaks peer-voting (peer voters must be confirmed_present, and creators
-- often need to vote on small-group activities).
